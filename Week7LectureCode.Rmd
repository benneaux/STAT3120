## Example â€“ Inference for a group of Normal means
We consider an example on corn yields. We have 5 different corn growers giving individual yields for a particular new type of corn, distributed by a research station to the growers. Growers give yields for 3 years in tons/hectare. The data is below


```{r Q1}
x2=seq(5,25,by=0.001)
mu=16.11

tau=1.82
px2=-(x2-mu)^2/(2*tau^2)-3/2*log(1+3*(x2-mean(y2))^2/(2*var(y2))) 
plot(x2,exp(px2),type = 'l')

x4=seq(5,25,by=0.001) 
px4=-(x4-mu)^2/(2*tau^2)-3/2*log(1+3*(x4-mean(y4))^2/(2*var(y4))) 
lines(x4,exp(px4),col=2)

```
